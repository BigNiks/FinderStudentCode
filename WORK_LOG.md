| October 28 |    9:20-9:55 AM    |                                                                                                          I have a couple different ideas on how to approach this problem, first is to use binary search in my solution. Second would be to create my own hashmap. I would go with the hashmap solution but I am not able to use the hashmap function. |
| October 29 |       2-3 PM       |                                                                                                                                                       I explored the possibility of a binary search solution, but I feel like hashing/hashmap might ultimately be the way to go. The only issue would be finding a P value that is in the sweet spot. |
| October 30 |       5-6 PM       |             I have scrapped the idea of binary search and am now focusing on hashmaps. I think I can kind of combine a hashmap and a trie to solve this. ALthough I don't really know where to start. I have created a hash function that I am going to need to tweak in order for it to work. I also am trying to split the key and value currently. |
| November 2 |       4-5 PM       |                             Today we learned about linear probing within hashmaps. I understood it pretty well in the sense that the whole point is to maximize space and effiency, however I am kinda stumped as to how to aproach the resize() method. I spent most of my time today trying to think it through and figure out a possible solution. |
| November 4 | 12:45 PM - 1:45 PM | I decided to circle back to resize and instead focus on coding out the rest of my HashMap class as well as finishing a prototype for query and buildTable. I worked on my add function although I'm pretty sure it won't work. But my whole goal was just to get something down to get a sense of the direction I need to head in in order to fix it. |
| November 7 |      8-10 PM       |                                             I finished working on my add function as well as my buildTable function. I don't think I will be able to finish my resize function as I had not had much time outside of class this week to work on it. I understand the topics pretty well but I couldn't really find the time to code it out this week. |
