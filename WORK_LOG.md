Second would be to create my own hashmap. I would go with the hashmap solution but I am not able to use the hashmap function. |

The only issue would be finding a P value that is in the sweet spot. |
| October 30 |    5-6 PM    | I have scrapped the idea of binary search and am now focusing on hashmaps. I think I can kind of combine a hashmap and a trie to solve this. ALthough I don't really know where to start. I have created a hash function that I am going to need to tweak in order for it to work. I also am trying to split the key and value currently. |
